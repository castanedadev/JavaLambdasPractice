# JavaLambdasPractice
Small Maven project to add Java examples using Lambda functions (Predicate, Consumer, Supplier, etc) - Data is being fetched from public APIs using Unirest utility

My code samples are merely for practice purposes and they're based out of the following courses:
- https://platzi.com/cursos/java-funcional/
- https://platzi.com/cursos/java-avanzado/

Credits to the public restful API [Animechan](https://animechan.vercel.app/) that provides good data for testing.
