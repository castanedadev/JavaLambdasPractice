Small project created with Maven to document my Java exercises using Lambda functions (Predicate, Consumer, Provider, etc.); the data used is fetched from the public APIs using the Unirest utility

My code examples are purely for practice purposes and are based on the following courses:
-   https://platzi.com/cursos/java-funcional/
-   https://platzi.com/courses/java-advanced/

Credits to the cool public API [Animechan](https://animechan.vercel.app/) providing good data for the test.
